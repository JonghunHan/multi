#Each entry has to start with the interface name, newline and then the options
#Valid options are:
#- (address, netmask, gateway): If one is present, the other two has to be there
#- metric: desired metric for interface (must be between 1 and 32)
#- proto: either static or other. latter means that multi assumes how to get IP.
